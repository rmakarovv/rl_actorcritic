The following python notebook contains my solution for creating a Reinforcement Learning agent that will move several cargos across the gridworld into a common desirable rectangle area.

I solve the task using ActorCritic model. The training is done on training examples that are generated by a handwritten function.

Requirements:

    pip install torch
    pip install numpy
